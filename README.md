
Leave Management App

Overview
The Leave Management App is designed to streamline the process of managing employee leave requests. It offers features for applying, approving, and reviewing leave requests, and includes functionalities for both employees and managers.

Features
1. Leave Summary Cards
 
      Description: Displays a summary of leave balances for different leave types (e.g., Sick Leave, Casual Leave, Paternity 
      Leave, Maternity Leave).
   
      Functionality: Dynamically updates based on the employee's leave data fetched from the server.
   
       - The application displays a list of upcoming holidays for the current year. It filters out holidays that have 
         already passed and only shows those that are yet to occur.

       - Past holidays within the current year are displayed separately. This allows users to review holidays that have 
         already occurred.
   
       - Personal holidays for the current year are shown, including details such as the reason for each leave. This helps 
         employees keep track of their own leave history.

          providing a record of all personal leave taken.
